Taking the data we had to see if the company is worth investing and to show each individual companys returns. Also the purpose of this was to be able to increase my understanding macros and coding using VBA syntax and being able to manipulate the code to get the results I need.

- When comparing the stock performance from 2017 and 2018 we can see very different results:
![total data 2017](/total_2017.png)
